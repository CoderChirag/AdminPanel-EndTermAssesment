# Admin Panel

A complete **Admin Panel** made for collecting responses for contact section of a website. Having proper **Google OAuth authentication** to authenticate the users.
<br></br>

The website consists of 3 pages: Home Page, About Page, and Contact Page and an Admin Panel. The users can send their responses from the Contact Page. All the responses sent by users are stored in Firebase and an administrator can view the responses from the admin panel.

All the pages are routed using **react router dom**. The main attraction of the project, is the architecture of the code. The project architecture, file and folder structure, and the naming conventions closely resembles to that of any real industry project. It is built keeping in mind the famous **Atomic Design** architecture. The project achieves a great level of **Abstraction** and **Encapsulation** by separating each functionality into separate files and modules. The code is completely modular and very easy to read and edit.
